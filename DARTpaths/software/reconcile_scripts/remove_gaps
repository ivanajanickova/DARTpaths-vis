## Calls Gblocks to remove major gaps in alignment.
## Parameters (b2-5) are chosen to represent a very wide margin for position selection: we just want to remove massive gaps. 
# -b2=0 sets -b to minimum value, -b3 is 10*default to allow for acceptance of non-conserverd positions, -b4 is set to minimum block-size, -b5 is set to allow all gap-positions to be selected)

### default original values
### used for all the analysis after AHR.(used in AHR also except for HSP(big data set) )
### effective since: 2020/Mar/06
